# Topology in Condensed Matter Physics
A collection of the hands-on assignments for [TU Delft's online course in topology](https://topocondmat.org/).


## Hands-on
I have more or less finished all the assignments. There may be one here or there that I have not looked at. They are formatted as a Jupyter Notebook with some of my comments in [Hands-on.ipynb](Hands-on.ipynb). 

Disclaimer: In no way do I guarantee the correctness of these assignments. These are just my attempts at them :)
